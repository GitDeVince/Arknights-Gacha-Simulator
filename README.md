# Arknights-Gacha-Simulator
The bare minimum of how gacha works in Arknights. 
You can select standard 10 pull (all operators are available) or featured 10 pull (you can select any 6 and 5 star operators as boosted odds).
Rates for the gacha are:
2% for 6*, 8% for 5*, 50% for 4*, and 40% for 3*. Featured operators will have a 50% chance to appear after the first check
All available operators from Joint Operation 8 (June 23, 2023 to July 4, 2023) except the 6 star alters in the global banner list are in it.
Unlike from the original game, this one has not implemented the pity system (for now).
